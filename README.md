**DESCRIPTION**: The File Integrity Checker is a Python-based tool designed to monitor changes in files by computing and comparing hash values using cryptographic algorithms. This tool ensures data integrity by detecting unauthorized modifications, accidental changes, or deletions. It primarily utilizes Pythonâ€™s built-in hashlib library to generate SHA-256 hashes, storing the original file hashes as a baseline in a JSON file. When the integrity check is performed, the script recalculates the hash of the monitored file and compares it with the stored baseline. If discrepancies are found, it notifies the user of modifications or deletions. Other key libraries used include json for data storage and os for file handling. The tool operates via a simple command-line interface, allowing users to generate a baseline hash and later check for integrity violations. It is particularly useful for system administrators, cybersecurity professionals, and developers who need to ensure file consistency and detect tampering. Future enhancements could include automated monitoring, logging mechanisms, and email notifications for security alerts. This project demonstrates fundamental cybersecurity concepts such as hashing, file monitoring, and automation, making it a valuable asset for security-conscious users.
